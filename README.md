# Airline Reservation System
A simple console-based airline reservation system built with Java, designed to manage flight bookings, cancellations, and seat availability using Object-Oriented Programming principles.

## Features
- View available flights with details (flight number, source, destination, available seats)
- Book a flight by selecting a flight and seat
- Cancel reservations using a unique reservation ID
- Manage seat availability with a boolean array

## Technologies
- **Java**: Core programming language with OOP (Classes, Encapsulation)
- **Data Structures**: ArrayList for flights and passengers, boolean array for seat management
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub for version control

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Abder-r7manMagdi/Airline-Reservation-System-simple-project-.git`
2. Open the project in a Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
3. Run `AirlineReservationSystem.java`.

## Installation
- Java JDK 8 or higher is required.
- No external dependencies needed.

## Project Structure
- `Flight.java`: Stores flight details (number, source, destination, seats).
- `Passenger.java`: Manages passenger information (name, reservation ID, seat).
- `ReservationSystem.java`: Handles core logic (display flights, book, cancel).
- `AirlineReservationSystem.java`: Main entry point for the application.

## Future Improvements
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing or JavaFX.
- Implement a MySQL database for persistent data storage using JDBC.
- Add unit tests with JUnit to ensure code reliability.
- Develop a REST API using Spring Boot for integration with frontend frameworks like React.js.
